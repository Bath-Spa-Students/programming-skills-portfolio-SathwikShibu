'''Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
•Write an if statement to test whether the aliens color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 10 points.
•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)'''

alien_color = "Red"
if alien_color == "Red":
    print("Congrats! You have earned 10 points!")

alien_color = "Blue"
if alien_color == "Blue":
    print("Congrats! You have earned 10 points!")
